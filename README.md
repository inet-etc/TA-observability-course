# Test Automation Observability course

My temporary repo as playground for the [oberservability course](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/observability-for-test-automation/) as described below:

This is the source code for my free course on observability for test automators.

This course builds a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline around the test suite created in the [free Selenium WebDriver for Java tutorial](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/selenium-webdriver-tutorial-java/) on Test Automation University by [Angie Jones](https://github.com/angiejones) which covers beginner to advanced topics in Selenium WebDriver.

Then this course will also introduce observability into this pipeline through introducing metric and event output which can be viewed in a local [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) instance or a free [Honeycomb]() account.
